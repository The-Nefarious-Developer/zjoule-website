**zJoule** is an Open Source AI assistant plugin for Eclipse designed to integrate the SAP AI Core Generative AI Hub foundation-models into your development environment.

## Motivation

The official Joule version for ADT is being rolled out exclusively for S/4HANA Private Cloud and SAP BTP, ABAP Environment at the end of Q1 of 2025. But donâ€™t worry, this plugin was created to bridges the gap! It introduces an AI-powered chat interface that seamlessly connects other types of SAP systems to large language models (LLMs) through SAP AI Core.

The idea is to open the door to integrate SAP ABAP development with new models and innovative features that could emerge from the expanding possibilities of AI. 

All from the cozy confines of your Eclipse ADT =)
